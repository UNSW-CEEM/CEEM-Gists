Please only share code snippets or scripts that you are happy to be available publicly.

## Preparing your script/code

1. Though the website and repository contains license conditions, we suggest you include this snippet as a preface to any source code:

    ```text
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

        (at your option) any later version.

        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

    ```

2. [Optional] Format your code using [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [isort](https://github.com/pycqa/isort/). This step is optional because these will be automatically run on any pull requests.

3. Fork [this repo](https://github.com/UNSW-CEEM/CEEM-Gists) or clone and create a new branch

4. Add your source code to the folder that best matches what it does or pertains to.
    - If you need to create a new folder/page:
      - Create the folder in [`snippets`](https://github.com/UNSW-CEEM/CEEM-Gists/snippets)
      - Create a corresponding `.qmd` file in the root of the repository
      - In the [Quarto YAML config](https://github.com/UNSW-CEEM/CEEM-Gists/_quarto.yml), add the `.qmd` under the snippets menu
