## Dividing large AEMO Data CSVs into parquet partitions

This script can be run via the command line to divide a large AEMO data CSV (e.g. from the [Monthly Data Archive](https://visualisations.aemo.com.au/aemo/nemweb/index.html#mms-data-model), such as rebids in BIDPEROFFER) into Parquet partitions. This is advantageous for using packages such as [Dask](https://www.dask.org/) to analyse such data.

It assumes that the first row of the table is the header (i.e. columns) for a single data table.

### Requirements

Written using Python 3.11. Uses `pathlib` and type annotations, so probably need at least Python > 3.5.

```python {include="snippets/aemo_data/create_parquet_partitions.py"}
```
